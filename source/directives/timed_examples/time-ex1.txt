      :answer_e: Nothing will be printed due to an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
      :correct: b
      :feedback_a: This would be true if the loop was printing each character twice and was incrementing the index by 1, but it prints two characters at a time and increments the index by 2.
      :feedback_b: This will loop through the string and print two characters at a time. The first time through the loop index = 0 and it will print "12". The second time through the loop index = 2 and it will print "34". The third time through the loop index = 4 and it will print "56". Remember that the substring method that takes two integer values will start the substring at the first value and include up to the character before the second value.
      :feedback_c: This would be true if the loop was loop printing three characters at a time, but it prints two characters at a time.
      :feedback_d: This would be true if the index was incrementing by 1 instead of 2.
      :feedback_e: This would be true if the loop stopped when index was less than the string length instead of one less than the string length.

      Given the following code segment, what is printed when it is executed? 
   
      .. code-block:: java

         String test = "123456";
         for (int index = 0; index < test.length() - 1; index = index + 2)
         {
             System.out.print(test.substring(index,index+2));
         }
